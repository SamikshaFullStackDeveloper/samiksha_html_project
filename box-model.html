            Mahendra Singh Dhoni ; (born 7 July 1981) is an Indian professional cricketer who
            plays as a right handed batter and a wicket-keeper. Widely regarded as one of the most prolific
            wicket-keeper-batsmen and captains, he represented the Indian cricket team and was the captain of the side
            in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Dhoni has captained the
            most international matches and is the most successful Indian captain. He has led India to victory in the
            2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, being the only
            captain to win three different limited overs ICC tournaments. He also led the teams that won the Asia Cup in
            2010, 2016 and was a member of the title winning squad in 2018.
            Born in Ranchi, Dhoni made his first class debut for Bihar in 1999. He made his debut for the Indian cricket
            team on 23 December 2004 in an ODI against Bangladesh and played his first test a year later against Sri
            Lanka. In 2007, he became the captain of the ODI side before taking over in all formats by 2008. Dhoni
            retired from test cricket in 2014, but continued playing in limited overs cricket till 2019. He has scored
            17,266 runs in international cricket including 10,000 plus runs at an average of more than 50 in ODIs.

            ten occasions and winning it five times (2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023). He has also led CSK to two
            Champions League T20 titles in 2010 and 2014. Dhoni is amongst the few batsmen to have scored more than five
            thousand runs in the IPL, as well as being the first wicket-keeper to do so.
