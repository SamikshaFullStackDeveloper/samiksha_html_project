                Baghban (transl.Gardener) is a 2003 Indian Hindi-language drama film directed by Ravi Chopra,
                co-written and
                produced by B. R. Chopra. It tells the story of an elderly couple, Raj (Amitabh Bachchan) and Pooja
                (Hema
                Malini), who have been married for 40 years. After Raj retires, they reunite with their four sons
                (Aman
                Verma,
                Samir Soni, Saahil Chadha, and Nasir Khan) to discuss who will support them. None of the sons want
                to
                take care
                of both parents, causing Raj and Pooja to live separately.

                Baghban was conceived by producer and co-writer B. R. Chopra during his 1960s trip across Europe,
                when
                he
                visited a retirement home and was inspired by the householders' story. It was inspired by a Marathi
                movie "Tu
                Tithe Mi" by Smita Talwalkar. In one of the interview it was told that, special screening was set
                for
                Mr.
                Bachchan for the Marathi movie Tu Tithe Mi, later the movie was remade in Hindi as Baghban. Although
                the
                screenplay was finished in 1973, Chopra did not begin production for decades because he was busy
                with
                other
                projects. After he revived it, principal photography began in July 2002 in Film City with
                cinematographer Barun
                Mukherjee. During post-production, it was edited by Shailendra Doke, Godfrey Gonsalves, and Shashi
                Mane.
                Baghban's soundtrack was composed by Aadesh Shrivastava and Uttam Singh, with lyrics by Sameer.

                Tare Zameen Par (lit.'Stars on Earth'), also known as Like Stars on Earth in English, is a
                2007 Indian
                Hindi-language psychological drama film produced and directed by Aamir Khan. It stars Khan
                himself, with
                Darsheel Safary, Tanay Chheda, Vipin Sharma and Tisca Chopra. It explores the life and
                imagination of Ishaan
                (Safary), an artistically gifted 8-year-old boy whose poor academic performance leads his
                parents to send him to
                a boarding school, where a new art teacher Nikumbh (Khan) suspects that he is dyslexic and
                helps him to overcome
                his reading disorder.

                Creative director and writer Amole Gupte developed the idea with his wife Deepa Bhatia, who
                was the film's
                editor. Shankar Ehsaan Loy composed the score, and Prasoon Joshi wrote the lyrics for many
                of the songs.
                Principal photography took place in Mumbai, and in Panchgani's New Era High School, where
                some of the school's
                students participated in the filming.

                M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story is a 2016 Indian Hindi-language biographical
                sports
                drama film directed and
                co-written by Neeraj Pandey. It is based on the life of former Test, ODI and
                T20I captain of the Indian
                national
                cricket team, Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The film stars the late Sushant Singh
                Rajput
                as MS Dhoni, along with
                Disha
                Patani, Kiara Advani, and Anupam Kher. The film chronicles the life of Dhoni
                from a young age through a
                series
                of life events.
                The idea of the biopic was put forward by Dhoni's manager, Arun Pandey,
                after
                encountering an incident at an
                airport after the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final. Development began two years
                later, with the consent of
                Dhoni.
                Neeraj Pandey was later approached to helm the film while he was working on
                Baby. Pandey recruited a number
                of
                people for researching into Dhoni's background and his life events. Dhoni
                eventually became a consultant on
                the
                film.
