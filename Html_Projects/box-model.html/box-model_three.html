            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR 15 October 1931 27 July 2015 was an Indian
            aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and
            raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent
            the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
            India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.He thus came to be known as
            the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
            Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

            Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
            Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's
            President",he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single
            term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian
            honour.

            While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
            apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
            attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state
            honours.
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
            centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His
            father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;his mother Ashiamma was a
            housewife.His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between
            Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
            In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center
            in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an
            effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be
            successful.
